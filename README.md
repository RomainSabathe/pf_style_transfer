### What is this project? (140 chars)

The goal was to allow me 24hrs to build a simple webapp that applies the style transfer algorithm on a pre-selection of Pink Floyd images.


### Why this project? (140 chars)

I wanted to get a better understanding of Docker images and tiny web servers. The 24hrs thing is a constraint to output something quickly.


### Things I've learned (90 chars per thing):
    * How to quickly set up an AWS ElasticBeanstalk app.
    * How to build and push a docker image.
    * AWS ElasticBeanstalk adds a layer of complexity (nginx) that can make your app crash.
    * A [hack](https://stackoverflow.com/a/126831https://stackoverflow.com/a/126831)
    * to force browsers to refresh an image you updated.
    * Better understanding of Pytorch.


### Sidenotes:
    * Due to the time constraints, there are quite a number of nasty hacks in there...

### Resources I've used:
    * The style transfer solution is inspired by[Leon Gatys's code](https://github.com/leongatys/PytorchNeuralStyleTransfer).
    * This [great tutorial](https://docker-curriculum.com/) on Docker.
    * This [docker build](https://github.com/floydhub/dl-docker) for the GPU version.
    * Covers of Pink Floyd's albums and that's cool.
